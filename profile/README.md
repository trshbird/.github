Hi. I made this organization because it seemed like a cool way to explain my thoughts in a more professional manner. I'm not a suit and tie kind of person, and I promise you I will slip up and swear here and there, but approaching anyone who's interested this way seems a bit easier.

Right now, this organization is just me. Clayton.

I'll be doing lots of stuff here. Writing background story to this game I'm making, posting the music I make for the game...all sorts of neat things. If you work in Unreal 5, and are interested in working with me on this, shoot me a message. Forewarning, I'm inexperienced in Unreal, but I'm learning. I have experience in the industry already, I just wanted to make my own thing.

Bear with me as this place starts out scuffed. I hope within a few months to have quite a few more things added.
